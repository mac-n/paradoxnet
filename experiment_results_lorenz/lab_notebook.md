# Lab Notebook - Lorenz Experiment

**Date:** 2025-07-11

**Objective:** Compare the performance of three models (Standard, Paradox, Transformer) on the Lorenz attractor dataset.

**Models Tested:**

*   **Standard:** A standard feed-forward neural network with hidden dimensions of `[48, 96, 48]`.
*   **Paradox:** The ParadoxNet model with its default parameters.
*   **Transformer:** A single-head Transformer model with `d_model=48`, `n_heads=1`, `d_ff=96`, and `n_layers=4`.

**Experiment Details:**

*   **Dataset:** Lorenz attractor data, generated by `data_generators.generate_lorenz_data`.
*   **Seeds:** 5
*   **Epochs:** 100
*   **Batch Size:** 32

**Results:**

The results of the experiment are stored in the `detailed_experiment_results.json` and `summary_experiment_results.json` files in this directory.

**Summary of Findings:**

The Paradox model significantly outperformed both the standard and Transformer models on this task. The Transformer model performed the worst.
